        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin
            consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and
            often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives,
            vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
